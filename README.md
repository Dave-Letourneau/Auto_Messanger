# Auto_Messanger
This project allows users to toggle auto messenger on to send a custom message to anyone sending them texts. As an example, a user could toggle their message to say "Driving right now, can't talk". Anyone who sends the user a message while the app is on will automatically receive this text message. 
Created in summer of 2015 in order to gain technical skills with Android Studio, as well as learn the basics of android development.
